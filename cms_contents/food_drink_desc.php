 <p><strong>Food is an integral part of the overall experience at the Royal Derby Hotel, and we do take our food seriously! When the chef at the Royal Derby Hotel set about designing the menu, it was important to keep it simple but to ensure all the boxes were ticked when it came to quality produce. The menu outlines a more traditional pub fare, the type of food that can be enjoyed every night for a really competitive price. One may even say it&rsquo;s cheaper than buying the ingredients yourself and making it at home, not to mention ten times easier! Look out for our rotating seasonal specials.</strong></p>
