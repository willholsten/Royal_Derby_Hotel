<p>Kane Tancredi &ndash; an electrician by trade - and James Duncan &ndash; a qualified accountant &ndash; have been working round the clock to ensure every piece of the puzzle was in place for the rebirth of the Brunswick Street icon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since taking ownership of the Derby in early August we have been absolutely frantic,&rdquo; said Kane. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been working round the clock with a lot of help from family and friends to get everything just right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kane, a former Fitzroy (and current Brisbane Lions) supporter, said both he and James felt a real connection to the Fitzroy community and were excited about making their mark on the local pub scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since we threw open the doors to the public last week we&rsquo;ve been overwhelmed by the response from punters, with lots of locals keen to drop in and check out the new layout and design.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Opening night was a fantastic success,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;With more than 400 people attending the place was absolutely chockers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;James and I hired additional bar staff so we could relax a bit and enjoy the night, but due to the large crowd we &ndash; and our partners &ndash; ended up behind the bar serving drinks all night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To see it all come together and be so well received by the public has been extremely rewarding.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>James said the pair had made a range of significant alterations to the 137-year-old hotel, in an effort to highlight its history and tradition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Derby is a Fitzroy institution and everyone I speak to has a fantastic story to tell about the place,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So throughout the renovations we have made a real effort to reflect the history of the hotel and maintain its traditional feel, while at the same time injecting a bit of 21st Century style.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By removing the existing podiums and partition walls we have brought the interior back to what it once was and really opened up the dining and bar area, which then leads out onto the huge rear beer garden.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve also laid brand new floor boards and carpets, repainted throughout and completely refurbished the bar and beer garden,&rdquo; said James.</p>
<p>By offering traditional pub fare with a modern twist and cable TV sports broadcasts showing across 6 big LCD screens, Kane said he was confident that the new Derby would provide Brunswick Street punters with a unique product.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not a whole lot of places in inner city Melbourne where you can get a great meal and watch the Premier League soccer, the Super 15s rugby or AFL matches not broadcast on free to air, without the sound of pokies ringing in the background,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our aim is to fill that gap in the marketplace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the memorabilia includes an ash-coloured photo from the 1920s depicting The Royal Derby Social Club &ndash; a large group of debonair and mischievous gentleman in trenches and beautiful hats, posing outside the pub&rsquo;s fa&ccedil;ade &ndash; you know this is a pretty special place. Playing the kind of old school alternative jams that you want to get down to but that nowhere else seems to wantto give you, The Royal Derby is definitely a step above your average Brunswick Street hovel and you&rsquo;ll have slipped into its laid back fold in no time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got clean, wide open spaces including an enormous beer garden where all the rad action happens, such as the classic Spit Roast Sundays with live acoustic music. Along with the spit roast and steaks, have a go of the vegetarian curry or the New York style Buffalo Wings with blue cheese sauce, which are both highly recommendedas complement to the Derby&rsquo;s top brews: the wonderful Stone and Wood Pacific Ale, and the brand new one from Bulmer&rsquo;s, the Ginger. Of course you can always grab a Melbourne Bitter long neck, because the Derby encourages you to be festively greedy (responsibly). If you want to only appear demure, pots are $2.50 during Happy Hour (5pm &lsquo;til 6pm).</p>
