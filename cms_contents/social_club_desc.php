 <p><strong>When Royal Derby Hotel Management were researching the history of the pub, they came across some old photos from the 1920&rsquo;s. One of these photos was of the &lsquo;Royal Derby Social Club&rsquo;. The team decided to bring back to life an old tradition lost in time by restoring the old social club. In the 1920&rsquo;s, the pub was the meeting place for all the locals, before the television consumed our lives! Our intentions are to bring the old pub atmosphere back by again becoming the meeting place for locals as well as organising events so all can be social! More information coming soon.</strong></p>
